# The NBA Liberated Fandom Slot Machine

## What is it?
A slot machine to randomly choose NBA team(s) to follow in the pursuit of liberated fandom.

## Why am I building it?
In listening to Andrew Schlecht and Alex Speers on The Athletic NBA Show, I greatly enjoyed their *wheel of fandom* and wanted to use the concept for my own watching/writing purposes. I often struggle to decide which team I want to dig into and write about. I also believe watching a specific team closely over a period of time is the best way for me to gain insights. This Slot Machine will make those decisions for me, as well as giving me a coding project on which to get some reps.
